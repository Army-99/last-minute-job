# last-minute-job

Unfortunately, only in my free time I can develop this project, and in fact it is still not finished.

Developing with React, Next.JS, Moralis, Tailwind.

Thanks to moralis later it will be possible to implement the project on various networks. (For now only Ropsten Test Network)

The purpose of this project is for most people to use the blockchain to look for work and get paid once it is finished.
The worker can search for a job, and companies will be able to send private requests to workers with related messages.

# TODOS:
FRONTEND:
  Set CV link to be viewed

  (All)
  Show worker already hired in jobs and hourly pay
  Improve UX and UI
  
 SMARTCONTRACT:
  Change visibility of the functions and variables
  remove the unnecessary functions
  divide in 3 smart contracts - JobsContract - RequestsContract - HUBContract (will do in a second version)
