Upgrades in V2 Branch

Unfortunately, only in my free time I can develop this project, and in fact it is still not finished.

Developing with React, Next.JS, Moralis, Tailwind.

Thanks to moralis later it will be possible to implement the project on various networks. (For now only Ropsten Test Network)

The purpose of this project is for most people to use the blockchain to look for work and get paid once it is finished.
The worker can search for a job, and companies will be able to send private requests to workers with related messages.
